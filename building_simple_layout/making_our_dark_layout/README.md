When it comes to creating dark mode layouts, it's not as straightforward as inverting our colors from a white layout. 

We should always avoid absolute black, especially when we have white text on it, because it can cause eye-strain.

We can change the color of words surrounded by span tags to have a substantial effect on our UI. 

** We should always check our colors comply with WCAG 2.0 requirements (install a browser plugin if needed)
