When it comes to creating a layout, what content (elements) do we have to work with?

__In this example, it's just a little label and a headline.__

How should we position these in the layout?

Instead of thinking about all the possible ways to make it work, we should go back to our fundamentals, and once we do so, we will be able to build a very good design.

Reminder, these our fundamentals:
- White Space
- Color 
- Contrast 
- Scale
- Alignment
- Typography
- Visual Hierarchy

With a lot of whitespace, how can we fill it all out?

For gradients we can use cssgradient.io
