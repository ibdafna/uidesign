The first UI design fundamental that shapes a user's experience is color.

When we visit a website/app, before we process any of the information on the page, our eyes are exposed to color. This makes color extremely important from a UI design point of view.

Each color elicits a meaning, to a certain group of people. Green, for example, can be assiciated with wealth, nature, growth. Black can be associated with luxury, sophistication and elegance. 

The target audience will matter here, because what we want to project to that target group will geavily impact our color choice.

* Too many colors destroy equality
* We don't want to use colors which do not work well or complement each other well.
