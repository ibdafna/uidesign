Every element on a user interface has a level of importance. Some elements are more important than others. Visual hierarchy is how we establish this importance.

We can apply visual hierarchy in various ways:
1. Different positioning of the element compared to others in the same category
2. Apply different contrast on that element compared to others in the same category.
3. Giving the element a different color from that used on the other elements in the same category.
4. Different scale (size) for that element compared to others in the same category
5. A combination of the examples above.

* When we have a UI with a single call to action, for example a "Submit" button on a form, we want that button to stand out as much as possible. We can use scale, color and perhaps font selection to reinforce the importance of that button.
